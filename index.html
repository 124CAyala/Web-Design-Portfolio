      <p class=yes> I am Christian Ayala, an aspiring web designer currently attending my second year at Freehold High School.
        I spend alot of my freetime refining my skills as a web designer and playing videogames. I am currently based in Freehold,
         New Jersey. I do not have much experience in this field of work however I am looking to change that. i need only you to take
          a chance on me and give me the opportunity to impress you. I hope to build this portfolio in the near future.</p>
